# UWP-CSV-Parser
Original check in is a copy of the CSV WinRT parser I wrote and posted on MSDN Code Gallery, which was written for Windows 8.

##Goals for this project

First and foremost, I'd like to make it easier for developers to consume CSV files in Universal Windows Apps. As I work in the Civic Tech space, many open government datasets are published online in CSV format. 

Writing a CSV parser can quickly become the "poster child" of scope creep. At first what seems like a simple exercise can rapidly spiral into complexity. 

I want this project to remove that complexity.
